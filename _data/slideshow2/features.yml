      donation of $10,000 in support of the Bridging Generations campaign! This
      gift will help build meaningful connections between children and Veterans
      through Canadaâ€™s first dementia-friendly intergenerational childcare
      program, creating a place where generations learn from and enrich each
      other every day.

      Thank you the Royal Canadian Legion Branches for your continued support
      and dedication to Perley Health over the years! This past year they raised
      a total of $250,435 to purchase items from the Veterans' Priority Needs
      List to ensure all Veterans who call Perley Health home are able to live
      life to the fullest!


      Thank you for your commitment!
