    description: >-
      Thank you Royal Canadian Navy Curling Club - Senior Men's Division.  This
      incredible group has been supporting Perley since 1995, proving time and
      time again that they truly rock! Their tradition of giving—and their famed
      tot of rum—showcase the deep-rooted Navy spirit and commitment to helping
      others.


      Thanks to their unwavering support, they’ve made a major impact in the lives of our Seniors and Veterans. Your kindness and generosity are truly on the button!
