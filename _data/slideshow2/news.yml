    title: A Spirit of Generosity
    quote: Charles Zinck, who passed away in 2017, possessed a rare combination of
      selflessness, joy and compassion. To commemorate this spiritâ€”and to honour
      his gift-in-will - the multi-service clinic at Perley Health has been
      renamed the Zinck Interprofessional Clinic.

    quote: "> I think of you every morning when I arrive at the art studio early to
      enjoy my passion for creativity and working with my hands. Some think my
      military career makes me arrive so early, but it's my love of the Arts
      Program that makes me such an early bird!"
