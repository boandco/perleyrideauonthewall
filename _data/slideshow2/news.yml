      his gift-in-will - the multi-service clinic at Perley Health has been
      renamed the Zinck Interprofessional Clinic.

    title: I've Had Quite A Few Trips Around The Sun In My Life
    quote: "> I think of you every morning when I arrive at the art studio early to
      enjoy my passion for creativity and working with my hands. Some think my
