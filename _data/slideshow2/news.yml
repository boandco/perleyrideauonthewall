    quote: "> A key lesson I've learned during my nine years at Perley Health
      Foundation is the enduring power of hope. Most of us hope for a better
      future for ourselves and for our families. And we are willing to support
      initiatives that promise to improve the future."

  - quote: "> My father is strongly committed to Veterans, and to the Canadian
      Forces and the defence community. It was a tradition I was proud to carry
      forward. When my father needed specialized care, we were comforted to know
      that he would receive best-in-class care at Perley Health."
