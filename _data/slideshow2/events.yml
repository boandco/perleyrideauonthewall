    title: Jeannie Mundle Art Auction
    description: Local Artist Jeannie Mundle has generously donated a piece of her
      work to auction off in support of Perley Health. The tulip painting called
      Believe Me is an original acrylic on canvas. This is Jeannie's first red
      tulip painting and was created especially for this fundraiser. Tulips were
      one of Jeannie's first paintings over 10 years ago and were inspired by
      the Ottawa Tulip Festival. Now, tulips have become one of her most popular
      works. Tulips provide limitless options and are all unique in their
      colours, textures, and sizes. The canvas is 36x24.15.
